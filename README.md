# textarea.app

A notepad app that is driven completely by the community.

## How It Works

This piece of software is an experiment from myself that the only features added or changed come directly from users. Unless there's a request on the internet including GitHub issues, Tweets, etc I won't change or add anything. How I, and others who want to contribute through pull requests, should prioritize the work is by what's currently the top requested feature. 

As an example, even if a PR is sent in for "dark mode" if there's currently an issue with two +1s to change the font then the dark mode PR won't be merged until the font is changed.

## Contributing

There's currently no strict rules (as there's been no requests to change the current rules). The only rule is your PR won't be merged until all more important features have been complete. If there are no other requests with 2 or more requests then yours will be merged (assuming it works as described).

_Please provide an acceptance criteria in your PR so we can validate it's working as expected._
